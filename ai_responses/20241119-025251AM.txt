Here's a transcription and sentiment analysis of the audio:

**Transcription:**

"How often is too often for..." (followed by an unintelligible sound that seems to be a prolonged, high-pitched "p" sound).


**Sentiment Analysis:**

The sentiment is neutral. The question itself doesn't express any positive or negative emotion.  The incompleteness of the sentence makes a definitive sentiment analysis impossible, as the context (what "too often" refers to) is crucial.
